## Intro

We're going to work with some data from the DM dataset.

```{r load_data}
# Use haven to read the raw data straight off of GitHub!
raw_dm <- read_xpt(url("https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/raw/main/Updated/TDF_SDTM/dm.xpt"))
```

## Inner Join
In this section we will be exploring how to do an inner join.  

## Left Join
In this section we will be exploring how to do a left join. 

## Compare
Now that we've done both and inner and left join, let's look at what the data created through that process does.
